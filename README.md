## My process

### Built with

- BEM convention
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is my first project where I used Block Element Modifier (BEM) convention and Mobile-first workflow. In my opinion, the project was too small for experience the benefits of BEM but it was a good opportunity to get familiar with the concept.

### Continued development

In my future projects I will follow the BEM convention and mobile-first workflow because these are useful patterns and I felt slow when I used them.

### Useful resources

- [Block Element Modifier convention](https://getbem.com/introduction/) - This helped me to learn BEM. It's useful, especially for long-term and bigger projects. I will use it going forward.
